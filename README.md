# Amazon Seller Attrition and Retention — Account Health Improvement Program

## Overview
A data-driven program to proactively manage seller performance and reduce attrition by identifying and addressing compliance and operational risks before they result in enforcement actions.

## What
Developed a KPI-based monitoring system and dashboard to track seller performance, flag at-risk accounts, and guide account managers in targeted interventions.

## Why
During Amazon Egypt's 2021 Blitz Growth, stricter compliance measures raised the risk of seller suspensions. Without early detection and guidance, declining seller performance threatened retention, customer satisfaction, and marketplace growth.
